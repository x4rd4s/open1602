// Pictures of a content package's own: `graphics.toml` names PNG images, each a grid of sprites of
// one size, and gives them sprite numbers after the original's STADTFLD.BSH
// (docs/modding/graphics.md). A building a package added draws them (own_buildings.hpp, `gfx`).
// The numbers follow the packages' load order, so they are the same on every computer with the
// same packages; the islands' tiles keep them in savegames.
//
// `icons.toml` names PNG icons of the interface: a building's in the build menu, a good's, a
// message's in the status bar. Each gets a sprite number from kFirstPackageIcon, which any sheet of
// the interface draws in place of its own sprites (render::SdlUiRenderer).
