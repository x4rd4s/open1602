// The diplomacy window with more partners than VERTRAG.GAD has rows (Open1602): the original has
// rows for three partners, a game may have eleven. Up to three the window stays as it was; with
// more, a strip of their coats of arms in the frames the pirates' order window chooses a player
// with (PIRATORD.GAD, GFXPIRAT + 11) heads the window, and the chosen partner's treaties and the
// tribute follow below in the layout of the tribute page (TRIBUT.GAD), moved down by the strip.
//
// Offers a partner made that the local player has not answered yet also show in the status bar,
// as the original's treaty message icon in the partner's colour, until they are answered.
// Pure logic, so that the tests have it; the window itself is diplomacy_panel.cpp.
