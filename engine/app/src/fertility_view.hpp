// The fertility view (Open1602): whether a crop bears on each tile of an island, as the original
// decides it when a field is planted (sim::tile_fertile_at: the island's fertility for the crop,
// the Randwachs of the ground and a pattern). The tiles are tinted green where the crop bears and
// red where it does not. It shows by itself while a field or plantation is in the build tool, and
// with its key (Ctrl+B) for the crop of the selected farm. Pure logic, so that the tests have it.
