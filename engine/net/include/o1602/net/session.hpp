// A multiplayer game (ADR 0011): lockstep through the host. Every computer runs the whole game;
// only commands travel. The host collects the commands of all players, puts each into a frame
// and sends the frames, complete, to everyone; a computer runs a frame only once it has it whole.
// So all run the same commands at the same frame, and the deterministic simulation (ADR 0004)
// does the rest.
//
// Every few seconds each computer sends the host a fingerprint of its game (Simulation::
// state_hash()). One that differs gets the host's game anew, as a savegame (M-003): the same
// way a computer comes in at the start, comes into a running game or comes back after it lost
// the connection.
//
// A session drives the simulation in place of Simulation::advance(): it calls tick() for each
// frame. Nothing else may submit commands to the simulation or advance it while a session runs.
//
// Before the game there may be a lobby: the host has no game yet, only the slots of the game to
// come (Lobby). Computers come in, take slots, say they are ready and chat; when the host starts,
// it makes the game from the lobby and every computer gets it as it would get a running one.
//
// When the host leaves a running game, the game moves on (host migration): the host names one of
// the computers as its successor in the Roster and hands it the slots' tokens (Standby). That
// computer hosts the game from where its own is (a HostSession made from its ClientSession); the
// others follow it (a ClientSession made from theirs), come back into their slots with their tokens
// and get its game, as after a lost connection.
