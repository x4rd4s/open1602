// The build menu (docs/re/ui.md#baumenü): eight category buttons in BAU.GAD, and per category a
// pop-up of building icons in rows that the code builds itself (BuildMenu_OnCategoryPress
// 0x00432A70). Which buildings belong to which category is a table in the original's code, not
// data; here it is data (BuildMenuDefinition), with the original's lists as the default, and the
// packages' build_menu.toml add, move and remove buildings (ADR 0007, docs/modding/build-menu.md).
// The eight categories are the buttons of BAU.GAD.
