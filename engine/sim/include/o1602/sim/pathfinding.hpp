// Like the original, a search never covers the whole island: it runs in the catchment of the
// figure's home building, the circle of the building's Radius around its centre tile
// (0x00471280), so a figure never leaves it. Each tile of that window is blocked, walkable or a
// goal; walking off a tile costs 2 * Wegspeed straight and 91/32 * Wegspeed diagonally (64 and
// 91 on a road, 0x0046F8A0), corners are never cut, and goal tiles (the buildings a figure walks
// to) are entered but not crossed.
//
// The original runs the search in rounds of 64 cost units and assigns each tile to the neighbour
// that discovers it first, which is close to but not always the cheapest route. Open1602 runs an
// exact Dijkstra on the same integer costs with a fixed neighbour order and first-in-first-out
// ties: the result is deterministic on every computer (ADR 0004) and never worse than the
// original's.
