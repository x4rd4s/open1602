// Every house is visited about every 15.5 s (16 timer groups, 15 s + 64 ms * group). Its growth
// rate follows the city's food supply, the satisfaction of its class and the public buildings in
// reach: a fully supplied house grows by 8-12 % per visit, a neglected one shrinks. A full house
// queues to try out the next class; if the people are content, the services of the next class are
// there and the warehouse has the building material, it becomes a house of that class. A house
// that loses its people falls back a class, gives its people to the neighbours or turns into a
// ruin.
