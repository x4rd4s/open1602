// Volcanoes.
//
// A volcano is the big ore mountain with the record 21108; its origin tile is the crater. Once
// the game time has passed the next eruption time, the island epoch of an island with craters
// picks one of them and it erupts; the next eruption time moves on by an interval that shrinks
// with the number of craters in the world (35 minutes for one, 6 for twenty) plus up to 15.5
// minutes. The crater that erupted last may not be picked at the first try.
//
// An eruption throws 141 lumps of lava over 28.4 s of game time, slowly, then fast, then slowly
// again. Each lump flies in a steep arc 1 to 13.5 tiles away from the mountain. Where it lands, a
// house, workshop, farm, mine, market or shipyard catches fire; a Kontor, public and military
// buildings, walls, roads, bridges, fields and trees are destroyed to ruins. Figures are never
// hit, the ground stays as it was. An eruption also removes an ore deposit registered for the
// volcano mountain itself.
//
// Unlike the original, every computer computes the same lava at any frame rate (M-013, S-060), the
// eruption is checked independently of the drought (S-042), each eruption keeps its own crater
// (S-061), and the crater count follows the islands (S-063).
