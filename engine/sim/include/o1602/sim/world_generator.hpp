// The islands of a scenario that makes them at the start (docs/re/worldgen.md): the endless games
// of the original carry no islands but a world plan (SZENE) with each island's number, place, size
// class and climate. When the game starts, the original draws for each island one of the island
// templates of its climate and size, puts native villages on a few of them, hands out the
// plantation crops, ore and gold veins and treasures, and finds the volcano craters. It draws
// from a table of 512 random numbers saved with the scenario (RANDTAB), starting at an index the
// host rolls, so a file has 512 possible worlds.
//
// Open1602 turns such a file into an ordinary scenario with these islands (INSEL5 headers that
// point to the templates, the village records of the native templates), which the normal loader
// and the savegame writer then handle like any other.
