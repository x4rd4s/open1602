// A new endless game as the original starts it (docs/re/newgame.md): the mission screen picks the
// difficulty, the scenario list one of three map layouts; the game loads Endlosspiel<D><V>.szs,
// which carries the world plan, four start ships, the money and the settings of that difficulty,
// makes the islands (world_generator.hpp) and resets what it does not take from the file: the
// players' control, colour and names, the game time and the clocks of droughts and volcanoes.
// A multiplayer endless game loads Endlosspiel<D><V>.szm instead: maps of their own, and every
// player starts with the small trading cog. Those are the German game's names; other languages
// name the files their own way (find_endless_file).
//
// Open1602 builds the scenario as the original would have it after that reset and loads it like
// any other, so the savegame writer has the right records to start from.
