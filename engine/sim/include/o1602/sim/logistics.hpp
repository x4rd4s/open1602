// Goods on the move between the buildings of a city (docs/re/logistics.md):
//
// - Carriers: a workshop that runs short of raw material sends a carrier (0x0044AB60). He walks
//   over roads and open ground to the nearest building of his city that has the ware - a producer
//   of it, a market or the warehouse - takes up to what he can carry and brings it home.
// - Market carts: every market and warehouse sends carts (up to Figuranz, 0x0044AD50). A cart
//   drives on roads to the fullest producer of the city in its circle and brings the goods to the
//   city's warehouse. Finished goods are always collected; raw material and intermediate goods
//   only from a full store, the rest is left to the carriers of the next workshop.
//
// Goods are reserved when a figure sets out, so two figures never count on the same ton. A
// figure walks only inside the circle of its home building (pathfinding.hpp). Everything runs
// in fixed ticks with integer positions (ADR 0004); figures are not saved, like in the original.
