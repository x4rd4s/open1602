//
// A build order is a list of buildings a player wants to place on one island, in the order of the
// drag (a road, a field area) or a single building. Like the original (0x004084D0), the whole
// order belongs to the city under its first item; items are checked one after the other, costs add
// up in that order, and once the money or a material runs out that item and all later ones stay
// unbuilt. Unlike the original, every peer checks the order itself (the original sent the result
// and trusted it, M-007), the unlocks are checked here and not only in the menu (S-014), and a building
// must lie completely in its city (S-008). Markets keep the rule of the original: one full edge in
// the city is enough, the rest may be free land, which the market's own circle then claims.
//
// Placing a building registers it with the lists of the simulation (production, houses, growth,
// shipyards and castles), claims territory for markets and Kontors, founds a city with the first
// Kontor on an island and pays the costs. Demolishing restores the ground, without refunds in the
// original and with the refund the game settings ask for in Open1602 (Rules::demolish_refund), and
// may shrink the territory: buildings that lose it change city or fall to ruins (0x00482120).
