// Island worlds beyond the original's three fixed plans (Weltengenerator Stufe 1, docs/re/worldgen.md
// "Eigene Welten"). The original has no generator for the layout: each endless game file carries a
// plan with every island's place and size class, and only the contents are drawn when the game
// starts. Open1602 makes such a plan itself for any map size and number of players - how many
// islands, which sizes, where they lie, which climate, where every player starts - and then lets the
// original's content passes (templates, villages, crops, ore, treasures; world_generator.hpp) fill it,
// with a pass that gives every start area the same: a big home island with iron, and all crops and
// gold within reach.
