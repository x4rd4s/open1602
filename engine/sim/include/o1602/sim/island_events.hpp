// Events of the islands, every 30 s per island: droughts.
//
// A drought lowers the fertility of an island. While it lasts, ripe fields that are not fertile at
// its strength wither, also when they are harvested. When it ends, its strength halves every
// epoch, and each time the withered fields that are fertile again grow anew.
//
// Droughts come by chance once the game time has passed the next drought time: each island epoch
// of an island without a drought rolls on the drought table of the difficulty. A hit starts a
// drought if the island has a city of a human or computer player and pushes the next drought time
// 27 to 34 minutes on, whichever island it fell on. A curse of the natives starts a weaker one.
//
// Unlike the original, every island is handled at the same moment of its epoch and the events
// draw from their own random numbers (M-006). The volcanoes, which the original checks in the same
// place, have their own roll (volcanoes.hpp, S-042).
