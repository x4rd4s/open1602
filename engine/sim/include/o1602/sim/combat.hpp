// What ships, soldiers and towers share in a fight: who sees whom,
// how good a target is, and shots on their way.
//
// Every figure step the original builds a list of hostile figures within 12 tiles for each ship,
// soldier and tower. A shooter scores the entries with five tables
// (a target it can kill, a big share of its health per shot, a threat to itself, one it
// outranges, the distance beyond its range) and takes the best one it can hit. Damage does not
// depend on chance or distance; a shot lands after the shooter's Shottime on the target if it still
// exists. There is no projectile that could miss.
