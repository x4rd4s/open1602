// Writes a world as a savegame (.GAM) the original can load. Open1602
// saves its own games in its own format (save_game.hpp); this writer exports a game for the original
// as long as it fits the original's limits.
//
// The original loads its chunks in a fixed order, each acting on what came before: islands with
// their two layers of tiles (the ground, then what stands on it), the deer, the building lists,
// the cities, players, ships, soldiers and the timers; WIFF closes the file. Many records hold
// fields Open1602 does not model yet. The writer starts each record from the one in the file the
// world was loaded from and changes only what Open1602 keeps; a value the loader would have turned
// into the same state stays as it was, so a world saved without changes comes out byte for byte.
//
// What the original cannot hold (fires, robbers, lava, figures, more islands, cities or players
// than it knows) goes into a chunk of Open1602's own after WIFF, which the original skips
// (savegame_extension.hpp).
