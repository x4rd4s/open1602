// Ways of soldiers on land.
//
// Soldiers walk on a grid of half tiles: every island tile is 2 x 2 cells with the walking cost of
// its building. They walk only on roads, gates, open ground, ruins, squares, bridges and piers, never
// through forest, fields or buildings. Unlike carriers they have no catchment circle:
// the original plans in a square window around the soldier, with a goal that depends on
// the target: cells from which a hostile target is in range and in sight, or the target itself and
// the cells next to it. A target beyond the window is reached in legs through the window edge.
//
// Open1602 runs an exact Dijkstra on the same integer costs with a fixed neighbour order, as for
// ships and carriers (ADR 0004).
