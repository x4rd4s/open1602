// The path a dragged road or wall takes.
//
// When the player drags a road or a wall, the original searches a path from the tile where the
// drag began to the tile under the cursor: a
// breadth-first search over the tiles of the start tile's city that may carry the road or wall,
// at most 257 steps. Of several shortest paths it takes the one whose tiles were reached first,
// with the neighbours visited north, south, west, east; in open land that is all steps along y,
// then all along x. A cursor it cannot reach gives just the cursor tile.
//
// This is a pure function of the map, so the interface can show it as a preview and the build
// order carries only its result. Other drag behaviours can live next to it later; the original is
// the default.
