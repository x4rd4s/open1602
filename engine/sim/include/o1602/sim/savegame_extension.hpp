// Open1602's own chunk of a savegame (docs/formats/o1602-chunk.md): the state the original's
// chunks cannot hold, after WIFF where the original skips it.
//
// The chunk is authoritative for what it holds: lists are saved whole and in their order (cities,
// houses, the production list with its free slots, growth, ships, soldiers, animals, disasters,
// volcanoes), together with the random generators, the clocks of the simulation and its figures.
// Tiles are saved only where loading the original's chunks would give something else (grass and
// fish outside cities). A game saved and loaded in Open1602 therefore continues exactly as if it
// had never stopped.
//
// The chunk starts with a fingerprint of the file in front of it. If the original saved the game
// again, the chunk is gone; if another tool changed the original's chunks, the fingerprint no
// longer matches and Open1602 loads only the original's chunks.
//
// Every part is a tagged section with its own version, so later versions can add parts and older
// readers skip what they do not know.
