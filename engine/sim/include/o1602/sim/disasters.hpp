// Fires and plagues.
//
// Every 60 to 67 seconds each city of a human or computer player may catch the plague (big cities
// of citizens and better), send out a robber (logistics.hpp) or catch fire (pioneers and settlers).
// A disaster sits on one building and lasts a number of 10-s epochs; every epoch it may spread: a
// plague to a house of the same city within 4 tiles over roads, a fire across buildings, walls and
// forest within 2 or 3 tiles. At the end a plague is over and a fire burns the building down.
// Doctors and firemen (logistics.hpp) end them earlier.
//
// While a house has a disaster, its inhabitants leave (houses.cpp); while a city has one, no house
// grows. A burning workshop does not work.
//
// Unlike the original, disasters are part of the world and do not vanish when a game is loaded
// (S-001), the count of a city follows its buildings when they change city, and every computer
// draws the same random numbers.
