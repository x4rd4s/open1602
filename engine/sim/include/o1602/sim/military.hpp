// Soldiers, cannon towers and what their shots do (docs/re/military.md).
//
// Like ships, a soldier decides what to do only at the end of each run of one to three half-tile
// cells, after an attack or a short wait (0x00456D00): whether a hostile figure is in range, whether
// to chase one, whether it has arrived. Towers look for a target once a second (0x00458AC0). Shots
// land after the shooter's Shottime (combat.hpp); a soldier dies at 0 health, a building falls to
// ruins at its Maxenergy. The original decides kills and destruction only on the attacker's computer;
// Open1602 computes everything on every computer from the same state (ADR 0004).
