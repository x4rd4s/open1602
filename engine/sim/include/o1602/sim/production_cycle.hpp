// The production cycle of workshops, farms, mines, hunters, fishers and markets, once per game
// second (the original's 0x0047DAF0, docs/re/production.md):
//
// A switched-on building counts down the seconds of its running cycle. When the cycle ends,
// the raw material it used is taken and its product added to the store (scaled by the cycle's
// rate). Then the next cycle starts if the store has room and raw material is there: the rate is
// the share of raw material for a full cycle (at most 128 = 100 %, below 64 = 50 % no work), the
// cycle lasts Interval * rate / 128 seconds. Without raw material the building waits 11 seconds
// and counts an idle cycle (the "no raw material" icon appears after Maxnorohst of them).
//
// Raw material is brought by carriers, farmers, miners ...: the cycle reports what a building asks
// for (NeedsRawGoods) and the logistics (logistics.hpp) sends the figures.
