# Classes of inhabitants

A content package may change the original's five classes of inhabitants (pioneers to aristocrats,
`BGRUPPE` of `haeuser.cod`) and add classes after them
([ADR 0007](../architecture/0007-extensibility-and-modding.md) section 2, item 3 of
[open-work.md](open-work.md)). A class's needs may name goods a package added
([goods.md](goods.md)), and a house a package added may belong to a new class
([own-buildings.md](own-buildings.md)).

**Status:** Done are the file `classes.toml`, houses of a new class, the house window, the goods
window and the savegame; levels a new class unlocks are in [levels.md](levels.md). Still open, with
the next steps of item 3: public buildings of a class's own (a new class needs what
the class it copies needs) and the tax rows of the city window (it has rows for the original's five).
The computer players build the producers of the packages' goods a class needs
([computer-players.md](computer-players.md)).

## The file

```
<user data folder>/mods/<package>/classes.toml
```

A table names the class it changes, or declares a new one:

- `["anno1602:<name or number>"]` changes a class of the original: `pioneers` 0, `settlers` 1,
  `citizens` 2, `merchants` 3, `aristocrats` 4.
- `["<package>:<name>"]` changes a class a package added, this one or one loaded before it.
- `[<name>]` adds the class `<package>:<name>` after the last. It starts as a copy of the last class
  (or of `like`) and takes the fields given. A name holds lower case letters, digits and `_`.

```toml
# mods/spice/classes.toml
["anno1602:merchants"]
need."spice:pepper" = 400     # merchants want pepper too
need."anno1602:alcohol" = 0   # and no longer alcohol

[governors]
like = "anno1602:aristocrats"
max_per_house = 60
tax = 300
need."spice:pepper" = 600
name.en = "Governors"
name.de = "Statthalter"
```

| Field | Limits | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `max_per_house` | 1 to 255 | inhabitants a house of the class holds (`Maxwohn`) |
| `tax` | 0 to 10000 | what an inhabitant pays, times 100 (`Steuer`: 1.4 is 140) |
| `share` | 0 to 100 | the supply of its goods, in percent, it asks for at the normal tax (`Prozent`) |
| `hiscore` | 0 to 10000 | points per inhabitant for the score (`Hiscore`) |
| `need."<good>"` | 0 to 100000 | kg of the good per 100 inhabitants and minute (`Ware`: 0.6 t is 600); 0 takes the need away |
| `name.<language>` | a text | the name in that language; a new class needs one |
| `like` | a class, `anno1602:<name or number>` or `<package>:<name>` | for a new class: the class it copies |

A good is named by its string id, `anno1602:<name or number>` ([goods.md](goods.md#the-file)) or
`<package>:<name>`, quoted because of the colon. Food is no need of this file: every class eats it, as
`haeuser.cod`'s `Nahrung` says. A table that names no class, with a field that is no field of a class
or with a value outside its limits is passed over with a warning that names the file and the line.
A game has at most eight classes: the goods statistics keep eight.

## Houses of a new class

A class is reached when a house of the class below grows beyond its room and the city has what the
next class needs: the house is rebuilt as the first house of that class. A new class needs a house
of a package that belongs to it:

```toml
# mods/spice/own_buildings.toml
[palace]
like = "anno1602:20651"       # the first house of the aristocrats
class = "spice:governors"
gfx = 2200
```

Without such a house nobody rises into the class. A new class needs the public buildings of the
class it copies, shows that class's faces in the house window, and has its needs, values and name
of its own.

## Savegames

A game keeps its classes, the original's as the packages changed them and the new ones (section
`CLAS` of [o1602-save.md](../formats/o1602-save.md)), so a running game does not change when a
package is changed or removed. A game with more than five classes cannot be saved as a savegame of
the original (`.gam`).

## In the code

`engine/assets/include/o1602/assets/resident_classes.hpp`: `apply_classes_file`, `class_of` and
`class_name`; `ResidentClass` (building_table.hpp) carries the id, the look and the names of a
package's class. `sim::World::resident_classes()` carries a game's classes; the game puts them into
its building table (`sim::apply_resident_classes`), which the simulation reads them from.
