# Computer players

The computer players build the production chains of the packages' goods without a file of their
own: what they build comes from the building table and the classes' needs. In which order each stage
of a city builds is a package's `computers.toml`; what they get from nowhere is a value of
`balance.toml`
([ADR 0007](../architecture/0007-extensibility-and-modding.md) section 3, item 5 of
[open-work.md](open-work.md), MD-4).

**Status:** Part 1 done on 2026-10-31: the producers of a package's goods that a class needs, down
to their farms and to the original's raw materials. Part 2 done on 2026-10-31: what they get from
nowhere, as values of `balance.toml`. Part 3 done on 2026-10-31: the stage orders, with the public
buildings, as data (`computers.toml`). Still open: the original's own Needs and how a stage moves
on to the next (they stay as the original has them).

## What the computers build

A good of a package ([goods.md](goods.md)) that a class of inhabitants needs
([classes.md](classes.md)) gets a producer: the first building in the table that makes it and that
the computers can place:

| The producer | Placed as | Its raw material |
|---|---|---|
| a workshop (`HANDWERK`), any footprint | a workshop beside a road near the Kontor or a market | nothing, a good of the original or a good of a package |
| a plantation (`PLANTAGE`) of 2 x 2 tiles | a farm with its fields | a crop of the original (`anno1602:45` to `anno1602:51`): the island must grow it |
| a pasture (`WEIDETIER`) of 2 x 2 tiles | a farm with its grass | grass (`anno1602:52`) |

The raw material of a workshop that is a package's good gets its producer the same way, and so on
down the chain. A workshop that uses a good of the original waits for the original's producer of it
and asks for one when the city has none (the tools of a package's workshop bring a toolsmith). A
chain that comes round to itself (`a` from `b`, `b` from `a`) does not wait for itself: the first of
its producers is built without its raw material.

Mines, fisheries, hunters and farms of another size are not built for a package's good; the good
then has to come by trade. Only the first raw material (`raw`) is followed, not the second (`raw2`).

## How many

A city wants as many producers of a good as its inhabitants use of it, together with what the
producers that use the good take, at full rate: a producer that makes 1 t every 20 s (3 t a minute)
serves 3 t of the inhabitants' needs a minute. At most eight producers of a good per city. The
values come from the building's `Prodmenge`, `Rohmenge` and `Interval` ([values.md](values.md)) and
the class's `need` ([classes.md](classes.md)).

## When

A city asks for these producers after each list of its stage ([ai.md](../re/ai.md)), once the
original's buildings of the list are there or cannot be built: a producer is planned when the city
can pay for it (a farm also for its fields) and has unlocked it. As with the original's buildings, a
site that cannot be found is tried again a few times, then the city waits until land on its island
becomes free or it starts anew.

The computers count the producers of a package's goods in slots after the original's 55 (section
`AIST` of the savegame, version 5); a game of the original has no such slots, and its computers
play as before.

## When a city moves on

A computer's city goes through its stages ([in which order](#in-which-order)) by its inhabitants,
the computer's gold and the free land of its island: a city just founded becomes the pioneers' with
two inhabitants, the settlers' with 22, and so on. These numbers are values of `balance.toml`'s
table `[computer_stages]` ([balance.md](balance.md#the-values)), with the original's as defaults:

```toml
# mods/eager/balance.toml: computers that hurry on to the merchants.
[computer_stages]
merchants_citizens = 200
merchants_rich_money = 15000
```

A game keeps them (savegame `BALA` version 3).

## In which order

Each stage of a city ([ai.md](../re/ai.md), task 5) goes through its lists of what it needs, in
order, and stops at the first entry that finds something to do. A package's `computers.toml` gives
a list anew (`order`) or adds entries after it (`append`); a list it does not name stays the
original's, and a later package changes what an earlier one gave:

```toml
# mods/pepper/computers.toml: the settlers build their pepper mills early, and no chapel
[settlers]
order = "market 0, woodcutter 2, pepper:pepper 2, sheep 2, weaving_hut 1, fisher 2, houses 18, quarry 1, stonemason 1, houses 24"

# the aristocrats also want a theatre without 8000 gold
[aristocrats]
append = "theatre 1"
```

The lists and when a stage goes through them:

| List | Stage |
|---|---|
| `founded` | a city just founded |
| `colony`, then `colony_materials` | a colony (between them its farms by the island's crops) |
| `pioneers`, `settlers` | the home city's first two stages |
| `second`, `second_luxury`, `second_farming` | a second city: first, then with luxury crops, else farming |
| `main`, then `main_rich` | the main city (`main_rich` holds only with 4000 gold, its entries say so) |
| `main2`, `citizens`, `citizens2`, `citizens_small` | the main city on to the citizens; `citizens_small` with little land |
| `merchants`, `merchants_luxury`, `merchants_tail` | the merchants; `merchants_luxury` once their luxury goods are in stock |
| `merchants2`, `merchants2_tail` | the second stage of merchants |
| `merchants_small`, `merchants_small_tail` | merchants with little land, who stay there |
| `aristocrats`, `aristocrats2` | the aristocrats |

An order is a string of entries separated by commas; an entry is a name, its number and its
conditions, separated by spaces:

| Entry | Builds |
|---|---|
| `woodcutter n`, `hunter`, `grain_farm`, `mill`, `bakery`, `quarry`, `stonemason`, `cotton`, `weaving_hut`, `weaving_mill`, `wine`, `spices`, `cocoa`, `cattle`, `butcher`, `tobacco`, `tobacco_goods`, `iron_mine`, `smelter`, `toolsmith`, `tailor`, `sheep`, `sugar`, `rum`, `fisher`, `swords`, `muskets`, `cannons`, `gold_mine`, `goldsmith` | producers until the city has `n` (the original's Needs: a weaving hut becomes a weaving mill and sheep cotton where cotton grows fully) |
| `chapel n`, `tavern`, `school`, `doctor`, `gallows`, `fire_brigade`, `church`, `bath_house`, `college`, `theatre` | public buildings until the city has `n`; with `covered` also where houses lack its service (the chapel, the gallows and the fire brigade always look) |
| `<package>:<good> n` | producers of a package's good until the city has `n`, if the computers build any ([below](#what-the-computers-build): a class needs it or a producer uses it) |
| `market n` | markets until the land reaches its houses (`n`: the original's parameter, 0 or 1) |
| `houses n` | houses until the city has `n` |
| `kontor n` | the Kontor up to level `n` (1 to 4) |
| `tower n` | towers until the city has `n` |
| `luxury n` | `n` fields of luxury crops; with `one_crop` of one crop only |
| `colony_luxury n` | a colony's luxury fields: one per `n` tiles of its land |
| `colony n` | a new colony (`n`: the original's mode, 1 to 4) |
| `castle`, `monument`, `shipyard` | one of them |
| `processing`, `iron_tools`, `weapons` | the workshops of the raw materials the city has; iron and tools; weapons |
| `roads_if_mason` | stone roads once the city has a stonemason |

Numbers go up to 1000, an order has at most 64 entries. A condition on the money of the computer:
`gold_4000`, `gold_5000` or `gold_8000` after an entry tries it only with as much gold, `never` not
at all; `covered` and `one_crop` take the same endings (`covered_4000`: also where covered, with
4000 gold). An entry that cannot be read is passed over with a warning that names the file and the
line, the rest of the order is kept.

A game keeps the orders that differ from the original's (section `AIOR` of the savegame), so it
plays with them whatever the packages installed later say.

## What they get from nowhere

The original gives its computer players money and goods on every difficulty: steady money while
they are poor, money and bricks for a new city, and money, wood, tools, food and bricks while they are
behind the others. The amounts are values of the table `[computers]` of a package's
[`balance.toml`](balance.md#the-values), the original's by default:

```toml
# mods/fair/balance.toml: computers without gifts
[computers]
steady_money = 0
founding_money = 0
founding_bricks = 0
subsidy_poor_money = 0
subsidy_money = 0
subsidy_wood = 0
subsidy_tools = 0
colony_wood = 0
colony_tools = 0
colony_food = 0
colony_bricks = 0
```

A game keeps them with its other balance values (section `BALA` version 2 of the savegame).

## In the code

`engine/sim/include/o1602/sim/computer_orders.hpp`: the orders (`ComputerNeed`, `ComputerList`,
`default_order`, `apply_computers_file`), kept in `Balance::computer_orders`; `Engine::run_stage`
and `Engine::first_need` in `ai_planner.cpp` go through them.

`engine/sim/src/ai/ai_chains.hpp`: `package_needs` (the producers from the building table),
`package_wanted` (how many a city wants); `Engine::package_chains` in `ai_planner.cpp` plans them,
the survey counts them (`Engine::package_slot`). The cheats: `Balance::ai_*`
(`engine/sim/include/o1602/sim/balance.hpp`), read by `Engine::cheats()` through `cheats_of`
(`ai_tables.hpp`).
