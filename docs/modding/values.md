# Values of buildings and figures

A content package can change single values of the original's buildings (`haeuser.cod`) and
figures (`figuren.cod`: carriers, soldiers, ships) without shipping changed `.cod` files
([ADR 0007](../architecture/0007-extensibility-and-modding.md) section 2, item 2 of
[open-work.md](open-work.md)).

**Status:** Done are the fields below, the files `buildings.toml` and `figures.toml` and saving
the values with the game, and [names](#names) for the original's buildings and figures. A table of
`buildings.toml` may also name a building a package added
([own-buildings.md](own-buildings.md)), a table of `figures.toml` a figure a package added
([own-figures.md](own-figures.md)).

## The files

```
<user data folder>/mods/<package>/buildings.toml
<user data folder>/mods/<package>/figures.toml
```

Each table is named after an entry of the original, `["anno1602:<name>"]` with one of the
[names](#names) below, or `["anno1602:<number>"]`: for a building its `HAUS` Id from
`haeuser.cod` (`20503` is the bakery), for a figure its `FIGUR` number from `figuren.cod`. The
number may be decimal or `0x` hex. A field that is not given keeps its value.

```toml
# buildings.toml: a bakery that makes twice the bread and reaches further.
["anno1602:bakery"]
produce = 2
radius = 10
```

```toml
# figures.toml: tougher swordsmen, bigger ships.
["anno1602:swordsman"]
health = 30

["anno1602:small_merchant_ship"]
cannons = 10
```

Packages are read in their [load order](packages.md#load-order); a later one can change what an
earlier one set. A value outside its limits or that is no whole number is passed over with a
warning, as are unknown fields and tables of another package or of a number the data does not
have. A file that is no valid data file as a whole changes nothing. Problems go to the log with
the file and the line.

The buildings' tables may also stand in `balance.toml`, as they did before `buildings.toml`
existed ([balance.md](balance.md#the-buildings-values)).

## Names

The buildings are those of the build menu, named after `Text.cod` in its order, and a few of the
natives and pirates. A unit's name stands for its figures in the four player colours; to change one
colour only, write its number. Names are lower case.

## The figures' fields

`figuren.cod` gives soldiers and ships the same fields; each value below applies to whichever the
figure is.

| Field | `figuren.cod` | Limits | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `speed` | `Speed` | 1–10000 | walking or sailing speed, as the number in `figuren.cod` |

## In the game

The values apply to the games started afterwards: new games and scenarios or savegames of the
original. A game keeps the values it started with (sections `BLDV` and `FIGV` of
[o1602-save.md](../formats/o1602-save.md)), so a package installed or removed later does not change
it, and every computer of a multiplayer game plays with the host's. Each game starts from the
original's tables and sets its own values on them; the next game starts from the original's again.

## In the code

`engine/sim/include/o1602/sim/balance.hpp`: `Balance::buildings` with `kBuildingFields` and
`Balance::figures` with `kFigureFields`; `apply_buildings_file` and `apply_figures_file` read the
files, `apply_building_values` and `apply_figure_values` write a game's values into its tables.
