# Balance

Some numbers of the game's balance are values a content package can change instead of constants in
the code ([ADR 0007](../architecture/0007-extensibility-and-modding.md): a mod changes data, not
code). Their defaults are the original's.

**Status:** Done are the values below, the values of the original's buildings ([values.md](values.md)),
saving them with the game and the file `balance.toml` that changes them. More values follow as they
are needed; the needs of the inhabitants and the prices of the wares are still only in the original's
`.cod` files.

## The values

| Table | Field | Default | Limits | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trader` | `max_held` | 50 | 1–200 | tons of a ware the free trader holds at most |

| `castle` | `interval_seconds` | 10 | 1–600 | seconds of a castle's training step (one more when it has nothing to do) |
| `castle` | `unload_range` | 6 | 1–16 | tiles from a ship within which soldiers land |

| `computers` | `colony_food_below`, `colony_food` | 19, 9 | 0–100 | the same with food, before the computer's second inhabited city |
| `computers` | `colony_bricks_below`, `colony_bricks` | 19, 9 | 0–100 | the same with bricks, from its second inhabited city on |
| `computer_stages` | `pioneers_inhabitants` | 2 | 0–1000000 | a city just founded moves on to the pioneers with this many inhabitants |
| `computer_stages` | `colony_below_land` | 600 | 0–1000000 | ... or becomes a colony when its island has less free land than this (tiles) |

| `computer_stages` | `citizens2_citizens`, `citizens2_money`, `citizens2_rich_money` | 250, 6001, 20001 | as above | the citizens' second stage: citizens and above and gold, or gold alone |
| `computer_stages` | `merchants_citizens`, `merchants_money`, `merchants_rich_money` | 340, 6001, 25001 | as above | on to the merchants the same way |
| `computer_stages` | `merchants_land` | 951 | 0–1000000 | with less free land than this the city stays small instead |

| `computer_stages` | `aristocrats2_money` | 8001 | 0–10000000 | the aristocrats' second stage, with their luxury goods in stock |

The `computers` values are the original's cheats: what the computer players get from nowhere, on
every difficulty ([computer-players.md](computer-players.md#what-they-get-from-nowhere)). Values of
0 take a gift away. The `computer_stages` values say when a computer's city moves on to its next
stage ([computer-players.md](computer-players.md#when-a-city-moves-on)); inhabitants are counted
of the class named and the classes above it, gold is what the computer has.

A game keeps the values it started with: they are saved with it (section `BALA` of
[o1602-save.md](../formats/o1602-save.md), written only when they differ from the original's; version
2 holds the `computers` values and is written only when one of them differs, version 3 the
`computer_stages` values the same way), so a
mod installed or removed later does not change a running game, and every computer of a multiplayer
game plays with the host's.

## The buildings' values

A table named after a building of the original, `["anno1602:<name>"]` or `["anno1602:<Id>"]` with
the building's `HAUS` Id from `haeuser.cod` ([names](values.md#names)), changes single values of that building: production, running and build costs,
reach, hit points. These tables belong in `buildings.toml` now; `balance.toml` still takes them, as
it did before. The fields and their limits are in [values.md](values.md), with those of the
figures.

```toml
# A cheaper bakery that makes twice the bread.
["anno1602:bakery"]
produce = 2
running_cost = 10
```

### Revised bread production

The game setting "Bread production" (`Rules::revised_bread`, [ADR 0008](../architecture/0008-game-settings.md))
uses the same values, from `data/balance/revised_bread.toml`, compiled into the game: the grain farm
makes 2 t of grain per ripe field, the bakery 2 t of bread from 2 t of flour for 15 gold a minute
instead of 5. Three farms with 21 fields, two mills and a bakery then make about 6.3 t of bread a
minute instead of 1.5 t, for the same 6.3 gold per ton as two cattle farms and a butcher; meat and
fish stay as they are (`tests/data/test_food_chains.cpp` measures it). A package's values for the
same buildings go before the setting's. The setting is on by default; the original's settings
switch it off.

## Where a mod's changes are

```
<user data folder>/mods/<package>/balance.toml
```

The user data folder and the package's name are as for [messages](messages.md#where-a-mods-messages-are).
Packages are read in their [load order](packages.md#load-order); a later one can change what an earlier one set. The
changes apply to the games started afterwards: new games and scenarios or savegames of the original.
Problems are written to the log (standard error) with the file and the line.

## The file

`balance.toml` is the same part of [TOML](https://toml.io) as `messages.toml`. Each table changes
single fields; a field that is not given keeps its value:

```toml
# A harder game: the trader buys less, fires spread more easily.
[trader]
max_buy = 5

[disasters]
fire_spread = 40
```

A value outside its limits or that is no whole number is passed over with a warning, as are unknown
tables and fields. A file that is no valid data file as a whole changes nothing.

## In the code

`engine/sim/include/o1602/sim/balance.hpp`: `sim::Balance` with the values, `kBalanceFields` with
their names and limits, `apply_balance_file`; `World::balance()` is what the simulation reads.
The buildings' values are `Balance::buildings` with `kBuildingFields`; `apply_building_values` writes
them into the game's building table after restoring the original's, and `rule_building_values`
gives those of the settings (`data/balance/*.toml`).
