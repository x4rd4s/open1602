# 0012 – Goods statistics: a ledger per city, the window "Warenbilanz", the early warning

Status: accepted · 2026-10-23

The original shows what a warehouse holds, and a building's productivity, but not whether a city
makes more of a good than it uses. A player only learns of a shortage when the store is empty
("Es fehlt an …"). Open1602 adds statistics in the spirit of later Anno titles: for every good, what
was produced, bought and unloaded against what the inhabitants, the workshops, the soldiers and the
builders used and what was sold, for all of the player's cities or one island's, and a warning
before a good the people need runs out.

## Decision

1. **A ledger per city (`sim::GoodsLedger`, `City::ledger`).** Every movement of a good is booked
   where it happens, in 1/32 t like the stock, as one of the flows of `sim::GoodsFlow`:
   - in: `Produced`, `Bought`, `ShippedIn`, `Returned`;
   - out: `Residents`, `Workshops`, `Military`, `Construction`, `Sold`, `ShippedOut`, `Lost`;
   - and `Demand`, which is not a movement: what the inhabitants asked for. Together with
     `Residents` it gives how well they were supplied;
   - and four that count gold, not goods: `SoldValue` and `BoughtValue`, what the Kontor earned
     and paid for the good, and `TraderSoldValue` and `TraderBoughtValue`, the free trader's share;
   - and `Withheld`, not a movement either: what producers would have made while they stood still
     only because there was no room (see 9).

   Production and the raw material of a cycle are booked at the building when the cycle ends
   (`production_cycle.cpp`), not when a carrier brings the goods to the warehouse. The statistics
   show the economy, and intermediate goods that never reach the warehouse still count. Carriers
   moving goods between the warehouse and buildings are not booked, since they only move goods inside
   the city. Ships book `ShippedIn`/`ShippedOut` at a Kontor of their owner and `Bought`/`Sold` at
   another player's. The free trader and the natives book `Bought`/`Sold`. A city that changes hands
   starts a new ledger.

   The goods a computer player is given (`ai_world.cpp`, `add_goods`) are deliberately not booked.
   Computer players' statistics are never shown.
2. **Minutes and quarters.** Every game minute (`kGoodsMinuteMs`, the last step of the tick,
   `statistics`) the running counts become a sample, together with the stock at the minute's end.
   - The last 60 minutes are kept one by one.
   - The last 48 quarters of an hour (12 hours) are kept as average minutes.
   - A sample holds 16 bits per flow (up to 2047 t a minute) and 32 bits of stock.

   The memory is fixed per good, about 3 KB per good and city. Only goods ever booked have a ledger,
   so a long game costs no more than a short one.
3. **Deterministic and saved.** Integers and game time only ([ADR 0004](0004-deterministic-simulation.md)).
   - The ledgers are saved in the optional section `GLDG` ([o1602-save.md](../formats/o1602-save.md)),
     only for cities that have statistics.
   - They are part of the state hash, so a multiplayer game compares them like everything else. A
     computer that joins or resyncs gets them with the savegame
     ([ADR 0011](0011-multiplayer-lockstep.md)).
   - The gameplay does not depend on them. The early warning only puts a message on the screen.
   - Adding the section changed the hash of the AI's golden test (`test_ai.cpp`). Without `GLDG`, the
     hash is the old one.
4. **Only one's own cities.** `sim::GoodsScope` sums a player's cities, all of them or one island's.
   The window shows the local player's only. Allies and trading partners never see each other's
   figures, although every computer of a multiplayer game computes all of them.
5. **The early warning (`CityEvent::Kind::RunningLow`).** Once a minute, for the cities of human
   players and the goods the inhabitants consume (`consumer_goods`):
   - The rule: the inhabitants used the good in the last 5 minutes, there is still some in store,
     and at the balance of those minutes it lasts less than 5 minutes.
   - The warning comes once, in the voice of the original's "Es fehlt an …" (MELDUNG 0x34 +
     good − food) with its own text. The original's message for the empty store is then not repeated.
   - It is given again only after the stock has lasted 10 minutes once more (or grows).
6. **The window "Warenbilanz" (`app/goods_window.hpp`).** It opens over the map with F2 (key action
   `goods_statistics`, listed on the F1 page) or with the line "Warenbilanz" Open1602 adds to the
   player status (INFO.GAD). The game goes on behind it.
   - The table: the island (all, or one, by its city's name), the time averaged over (1, 5, 15 or
     60 game minutes; 5 at first) and the goods grouped as consumer goods, building material, raw
     materials and intermediates, and weapons; any other good booked in the player's cities (one a
     mod adds) follows under "Further goods", as the ledger takes any ware number. The columns are stock, produced, imported, used,
     exported, balance (green or red) and how long the stock lasts, plus the stock over the last
     46 minutes as a small chart.
   - A click on a good opens its page: the stock and the room for it, the balance and when the
     stock runs out or the store is full, each flow with a bar, and a chart of the last hour or
     12 hours (green in, red out, the stock as a brown area, an axis for each). Production is
     split by the kinds of building making the good ("Webstube (3)"): the ledger books only the
     total, so the page shares it out by what each kind made in its recent cycles
     (`sim::goods_producers`, from the buildings' own statistics, `Production::produced` over
     `elapsed`). Below, how well the inhabitants were supplied and how many producers work, wait
     for raw material or are switched off.
   - It is drawn on a parchment like the original's windows: a sandstone ground made once from a
     fixed seed (`app/parchment.hpp`) under ink-coloured text (`ui::kTextInk` and its green and
     red), with the form's grounds at half strength (`ui::FormStyle::translucent`).
7. **The trend at the Kontor.** The stock page of one's own Kontor or market (LAGER.GAD) shows at
   the foot of each good's icon what came in more than went out per minute over the last 5 game
   minutes of that city, green, or the other way round, red, on a half dark ground; nothing while
   it is below 0.05 t. A click on a good opens its page in the window "Warenbilanz" for the
   city's island. The trend is a setting of the window "Anzeige" (`display.goods_trend` in
   settings.cfg, on at first), since it adds to the original's picture.

8. **The other tabs.** Beside "Waren" the window has four tabs, all for the scope chosen above:
   - "Betriebe": every kind of production building with its number, its utilisation as the
     building window shows it (`app/production_utilisation.hpp`, the original's Prod_Utilisation),
     how many work, wait for raw material or are switched off, and their running costs. A click
     opens the page of its good.
   - "Bevölkerung": the inhabitants of each class with their satisfaction and taxes now, all of
     them and how many more than an hour ago, the supply of each need over the time chosen, and the
     classes over the last hour or 12 hours as a chart.
   - "Handel": per good the tons bought and sold at the Kontor in the time chosen, the gold and the
     average price per ton, and below it the trade with the free trader and with other players'
     ships. A click opens the page of the good.
   - "Finanzen": tax income, running costs, sales, purchases and the balance now (as the city
     window computes them) and on average over the time chosen, and their chart; the military
     costs only for all islands together, since soldiers and ships belong to no island.

   The history of the last two comes from `sim::CityHistory` (`City::history`): every game minute,
   for the cities of human players only, the city window's figures and the inhabitants of each
   class become a sample, kept like the goods by minute for an hour and by quarter for 12 hours.
   It is saved with the ledger in `GLDG` and is part of the state hash like it.

9. **A full warehouse is no shortage.** A producer whose own store is full waits until a cart
   takes its goods away, and the cart waits for room in the warehouse. With the warehouse full the
   producers of a good stand still, the production booked drops to what the city uses, and the
   balance hovers around zero or below, which reads as "not enough production". So for every wait
   of a producer that stands still only for want of room (`sim::waits_for_room`: switched on, its
   store full, raw material for a cycle, less than a cart's ton of room in the warehouse after what
   other carts bring), the cycle books as `Withheld` what the building would have made in the wait
   at full speed (`sim::full_speed_seconds`: the interval, for farms, hunters and fishers with the
   walks of their worker, as the building window counts its productivity). The fractions of a unit
   are carried along the building's statistics window, so nothing new is kept.
   - The window counts it as production: the column "Erzeugt", the balance, how long the stock
     lasts, the chart of the last minutes in the table and the production of a good's page include
     it (`FlowTotals::production`, `FlowTotals::balance`). The page also says how many producers
     wait for room.
   - The stock, the flows in and out of a good's chart and the trend at the Kontor stay the real
     movements (`FlowTotals::net`): the stock does not grow.
   - A producer that waits for a cart while the warehouse has room counts as before: that is a
     real bottleneck of the roads or carts.
   - `GLDG` version 2 holds the 17th flow; the writer takes it only when a ledger booked any.

## Consequences

- Every new place that moves goods must book them; the data test `test_goods_data.cpp` runs games
  of the original for 20 minutes and checks that the bookings add up to what the cities hold, with
  goods in buildings counted and only those on carts left over (about 1 % of what moved).
- Old savegames load with empty statistics; the original's files have none.
- The section can grow by a version later (more flows, longer history) without breaking older
  savegames.
