# 0010 – Controls and interface

Status: accepted · 2026-10-18 (key bindings confirmed as the default by the project owner)

## Context
The interface of the original has been rebuilt: side panel, build menu, the selection windows. Its
controls date from 1998: the left button gives commands, the right one cancels
(report on selection, to be moved into [ui.md](../re/ui.md)); many functions have no key, some keys no
function; sinking ships and declaring war happen without confirmation; some things the simulation could do
are not offered by the interface (exploring at the shipyard and the pirate warehouse, U-013).

The project owner wants to rework the interface so that new menus, settings and
information fit in and the controls follow today's real-time strategy games (2026-10-18).

## Decision
1. **The look stays, the controls become modern.** The graphics and layouts of the original are the
   basis; what the original hides or does not offer, the Open1602 interface may offer
   (example: exploring at the pirate warehouse and at the shipyard as a button, U-013). New windows and buttons
   are added as data (ADR 0007).
2. **Right-click gives commands** (default): move, attack, dock, trade depending on the target. A ship
   attacks another player's buildings, as in the original's military mode; their Kontor only when it may
   not trade there (a trade treaty; the pirates keep theirs at war), else it sails there to trade, and F
   first attacks it. The
   left-click controls of the original are a setting. The left button selects (click, box,
   Shift adds); Escape cancels and goes back one page. Dragging with the right or
   middle button still scrolls the map.
3. **Commands via the minimap:** a right-click on the minimap sends the selection there.
4. **Command chains:** Shift + right-click appends a command to the unit's queue
   (waypoints). The queue belongs to the simulation (command with "append", deterministic,
   saved); a trade route stays separate from it.
5. **Freely assignable keys** in the settings menu. The default follows today's strategy games
   (below); keys may be bound twice in different contexts (building, units) if
   these never apply at the same time. The original's key bindings are available as a second preset.
6. **Confirmations** before consequences that cannot be undone: sinking a ship, disbanding a unit
   and declaring war through an attack. The confirmation can be switched off in the settings.
7. **Videos of messages play in the minimap window**, and the game keeps running; a click on the
   video ends it. Intro, credits, victory and defeat stay full-screen.

Attack-move, hold position and jumping to idle units do not exist in the original.

No unit key is also a general key (2026-10-18: attack moved from A to F, stop from
S to H, and in exchange hold position on G, formation on C, spread out on Shift+C), so W A S D always
scroll. Only keys in contexts that never apply at the same time are bound twice: R and Delete (building:
rotate, demolish; units: route, disband), C (building: pipette; units: formation) and Tab.

Keys that matter by their place are bound by scancode (2026-10-19, review point 25): W A S D, Q and E
and the digits of the groups lie where they are on a US keyboard on every layout (AZERTY: Z Q S D, A
and E; the number row without Shift). Keys that stand for a word stay bound by keycode, where the
layout prints them (B building, K military, F attack). In `keys.cfg` a key by its place is written in
brackets, `general scroll_up = [W]`; where a press matches both kinds, the one by place wins.

Done (2026-10-18): table `ui::KeyBindings` with this default and the settings file
`keys.cfg` in the user's data folder (to be edited by hand until the settings menu exists; F1 shows the
bindings in pages with tabs like the History Edition's shortcut list: map and game, windows, building,
units and ships, view; Tab and the arrows or a click on a tab turn the page, `app::key_help_pages`), box selection, pixel-exact like the original, groups with the original's number key,
formations, filtering and Tab (types of the selection one after another; `ui::UnitSelection`), right-click and
minimap commands, command chains in the simulation, the confirmations, the military mode windows, the
message videos in the minimap window, attack-move (ships and soldiers attack enemies in
range, pursue them and then continue; in the savegame `STNC`), hold position (they
only shoot at enemies in range, do not pursue), quicksave and quickload (F5, F9) and the
explore button next to repair and pirates in the ship window (U-013), ship and city list (L,
Shift+L), diplomacy window with tribute (V; confirmation before breaking a peace treaty; with more
than the three partners VERTRAG.GAD has rows for, a strip of their coats of arms in the frames of
PIRATORD.GAD heads the window and the chosen partner's treaties, hand and tribute follow on the same
page; offers not answered yet stay in the status bar as the treaty message icon in the partner's
colour until they are, and a click there opens the window at that partner), the
settings of the side panel and the main menu for single player (scenarios, endless game, savegames),
the end screen after victory or defeat as in the original (ENDE.GAD; after a victory Escape goes
on with the game, which the original ends, with a hint over the buttons; with more players than its
four coats of arms, or players in further colours, these become a strip of all players in the order
of their points, with the rank under each, the scroll arrows of TRANSFER.GAD on both sides and the
shown player's rank under the name; Left and Right go through the players). Buildings are picked by
their pictures as the units are (2026-10-22): a click on any visible pixel of a building selects it,
also where the picture reaches over the tiles behind it, and the front-most picture wins, a building
in front of a unit included (`render::tiles_at_pixel`). Pictures that cannot be selected (ground,
roads, trees, fields) do not hide a building behind them. The pixels come from the sprites' masks,
so buildings of mods are covered without data of their own. Not yet: our own game menu (Escape) with save, load, settings and quit; the original's key
bindings as a second preset; F1 as help for the window under the mouse (today F1 shows the keys). The original
has no game menu: save, load and quit are in the settings of the side panel (done
with a confirmation before „Ende“ ("Quit")).

## Display: window size, full screen, interface and free zoom (2026-10-22)

The original knows 640 x 480, 800 x 600 and 1024 x 768 and three zoom levels. Open1602:

- **Any window size.** The window can be dragged to any size; the settings offer common sizes that
  fit the screen. The size is remembered in `settings.cfg` (`display.window`), `--size` wins over it.
- **Full screen at the desktop's resolution** (F11, Alt+Enter, or the settings): no change of the
  screen's mode, so switching is quick and works the same on Windows, macOS, X11 and Wayland, and
  HiDPI screens get their full resolution. The original's three resolution buttons in the settings
  of the side panel became "Fenster", "Vollbild" and "Anzeige …", the window with the rest.
- **The interface's size**: automatic (as large as the 1024 x 768 design fits, as before), or a
  percentage of the desktop's scale (100 %: the original's pixels on a normal screen, twice that on
  a HiDPI one), never larger than fits. A smaller interface leaves more of the window to the map;
  the side panel's parchment then goes on to the bottom. Full-screen menus (main menu, multiplayer,
  end screen) always fill the window as far as they fit.
- **Free zoom** (default; the original's three levels are a setting): the magnification is screen
  pixels per sprite pixel of the large level, 0.2 to 8. The camera shows it with the most detailed
  level whose sprites need not shrink below 0.75 (`render::zoom_for_magnification`) and scales them
  by the rest. A whole scale draws directly. Any other scale draws the sprites at the next whole
  scale into a texture, which is shrunk onto the screen with linear filtering
  (`render::SdlMapCanvas`): every sprite pixel keeps hard edges and only the screen pixels on its
  border mix two colours, so the art stays sharp without the uneven pixels of plain nearest
  scaling, and nothing shimmers while scrolling. The texture is at most twice the window's pixels
  (else one whole scale less, stretched a little and so a little softer; just above a whole scale
  that is the case), so that weak GPUs stay fluent; without a GPU (SDL's software renderer) at most
  the window's pixels. `O1602_MAP_CANVAS=N` allows N times the window's pixels (0: no limit) to try
  other limits. "einfache Pixel" draws straight at the scale instead. The wheel zooms by a quarter level per notch (touchpads finer), the
  zoom keys and buttons by half a level, Ctrl +/− by a whole one; the zoom glides there in about
  0.15 s and keeps the point under the mouse in place. Picking by the sprites' pixels works at any
  scale.

## Consequences
- Input runs through an action → key table (settings file), not through fixed keys in the
  code. The game's default keys are entries of that table (done, `keys.cfg`).
- The simulation needs a command queue per ship and unit as well as group commands with
  an offset per unit.
- Deviations from the original in the controls are not bugs in the sense of ADR 0006, but
  interface settings; the simulation is not affected by them.
