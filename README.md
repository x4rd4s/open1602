# Open1602

**Open1602** is an open-source reimplementation of the engine of *Anno 1602* (1998, Max Design / Sunflowers).
The goal is a faithful game on modern systems (Linux, Windows, macOS), with the original's bugs fixed,
stable multiplayer and room for new features, quality-of-life improvements and mods.

> **Status (October 2026):** The simulation of the original is largely complete (construction, economy,
> population, disasters, ships and trade, military, diplomacy, pirates, computer opponents, new endless
> game, savegames in the original format). The game starts in the original's main menu and is played with
> its side panel; multiplayer runs in lockstep over the network with a lobby. The editor, parts of the
> interface and the modding foundations are still missing. What is done, open and unclear:
> [docs/status.md](docs/status.md).

## Download

Ready-built packages for Windows (64-bit), macOS (11 or newer, Apple silicon and Intel) and Linux
(x86-64, glibc 2.39 or newer) are on the [releases page](https://github.com/x4rd4s/open1602/releases).
They hold only the engine; the original game data comes from your own installation (below). The macOS
app is not notarised: start it the first time with a right click on `Open1602.app` > Open. The packages
are built by [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml), which publishes a release
for every pushed tag `vX.Y.Z` that matches the version in `CMakeLists.txt`. Its notes start with what changed,
written by hand in [docs/releases/](docs/releases) as `vX.Y.Z.md`.

## Original game data

Open1602 contains **no** game files. You need your own copy of *Anno 1602*, for example the GOG
"Königsedition" (*Anno 1602 – Creation of a New World*) or Ubisoft's *Anno 1602 History Edition*.
Both work completely, the History Edition's Bink 2 videos included. The game speaks the language of your
installation: a German Anno 1602 gives a German game, an English one an English game
([details](docs/modding/languages.md)).

Open1602 finds a GOG or Ubisoft installation on its own: on Windows through the folders GOG's
installer and Ubisoft Connect record and in `C:\GOG Games`, `GOG Galaxy\Games` and
`Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\games` under Program Files, on Linux and macOS in `~/GOG Games`,
`~/Games/Heroic`, `~/Games`, the default Wine prefix and the prefixes of Heroic, Bottles and
CrossOver (a folder whose name contains "1602"). The game files are only read, so the installation can stay under Program Files. If it
finds none, Open1602 asks for the folder of the installation with the system's folder dialog and
remembers it (`game_folder` in `settings.cfg` in the user's data folder); it asks again only when
that folder is moved or deleted. On Linux the dialog needs the desktop portal or `zenity`.

Open1602 looks in this order: `--game-dir DIR` on the command line, the environment variable
`ANNO1602_DIR`, the folder chosen in the dialog, the usual folders above, and only then asks. A
folder given with `--game-dir` or `ANNO1602_DIR` is never replaced: if it is wrong, Open1602 says so
and ends. To set the variable:

| Shell | Command |
|---|---|
| bash / zsh | `export ANNO1602_DIR="$HOME/Games/Heroic/Anno 1602"` |
| fish | `set -gx ANNO1602_DIR "$HOME/Games/Heroic/Anno 1602"` |
| PowerShell | `$env:ANNO1602_DIR = "C:\GOG Games\Anno 1602"` |
| cmd | `set ANNO1602_DIR=C:\GOG Games\Anno 1602` |

To keep it set, add the line to `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc`, use `set -Ux` once in fish, or `setx ANNO1602_DIR "..."`
on Windows. Quotes around the path are ignored, so `set ANNO1602_DIR="C:\GOG Games\Anno 1602"` works too. On Linux and macOS the GOG installer can be unpacked without Windows:
`innoextract setup_anno_1602*.exe` (or install it through Heroic or Wine).

## Building

Get the source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/x4rd4s/open1602
cd open1602
```

Requirements on every platform: CMake ≥ 3.25, Ninja, a 64-bit C++20 compiler and, for the game
itself, **SDL 3** and **zlib** (savegames and screenshots are compressed with it). The libraries,
tests and tools also build without zlib, but then cannot read or write compressed savegames. CI
builds with GCC 13, Clang 18, AppleClang 15 and MSVC from Visual Studio 2026; older compilers may
work but are not tested. 32-bit platforms are not supported.

The `release` and `vcpkg` presets build the game; every other preset builds only the libraries, the
tests and `o1602-tool` unless you add `-DO1602_BUILD_GAME=ON`. Configure says at the end whether the
game is built, and stops with the packages to install when SDL 3 or zlib is missing.
The presets are in [CMakePresets.json](CMakePresets.json): `release` for playing, `debug`, `asan`
(AddressSanitizer + UBSan) and `tsan` (ThreadSanitizer) for development, `ci` (warnings as errors) as in CI,
`coverage` (GCC, line and branch coverage with gcovr as in CI), `vcpkg` for Windows.

### Linux

Install the compiler, CMake, Ninja, SDL 3 and zlib, for example:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake ninja sdl3                 # Arch, CachyOS, Manjaro (zlib is already there)
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake ninja-build SDL3-devel zlib-devel     # Fedora 41+
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build libsdl3-dev zlib1g-dev  # Debian 13, Ubuntu 25.04+
```

Ubuntu 24.04 has no SDL 3 package; build it from source as CI does
(see [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) and pass `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<sdl3 install dir>`.
To build only the libraries, tests and `o1602-tool` without SDL 3, add `-DO1602_BUILD_GAME=OFF`.

```sh
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
ctest --preset release
```

### macOS

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (Apple Silicon and Intel):

```sh
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ninja sdl3      # zlib comes with macOS
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
ctest --preset release
```

### Windows

Install Visual Studio 2026 (or its Build Tools) with the workload "Desktop development with C++"; it
brings CMake and Ninja. SDL 3 and zlib come from [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io), which the `vcpkg` preset
uses. Open1602 is 64-bit only, so open the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2026** from the
start menu (not the "Developer Command Prompt", which targets 32-bit x86, and not a plain PowerShell
or terminal, which has no compiler). In it:

```bat
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg C:\vcpkg
C:\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
set VCPKG_ROOT=C:\vcpkg

cmake --preset vcpkg
cmake --build --preset vcpkg
ctest --preset vcpkg
```

`set VCPKG_ROOT=...` works in the Command Prompt only and lasts until it is closed, so repeat it in
every new prompt. In PowerShell, for example a Developer PowerShell started with `-Arch amd64`, write
`$env:VCPKG_ROOT = "C:\vcpkg"` instead; there `set` silently does nothing for CMake, which then fails
with "Could not find toolchain file: /scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake". Visual Studio's prompts may
already point VCPKG_ROOT at the vcpkg bundled with it; the line above switches to the clone, which is
what CI tests. `bootstrap-vcpkg.bat` has no 32- or 64-bit variant: it always downloads the 64-bit `vcpkg.exe`
(the ARM64 one on ARM). Which architecture the packages and the game are built for comes from the
prompt: vcpkg picks the 64-bit triplet `x64-windows` from the x64 prompt by itself; in a 32-bit
prompt the configure step stops with a hint. After a failed first configure, delete `build\vcpkg` and
run `cmake --preset vcpkg` again.

The `vcpkg` preset builds the game and copies `SDL3.dll` next to it; `vcpkg.json` pins the versions
with its `builtin-baseline`. Started by a double click, the game shows fatal errors in a message box
and writes its other messages to `open1602.log` in the data folder; started from a console, it writes
them there.

## Running

The `release` and `vcpkg` presets put the game and `o1602-tool` into the folder `bin/` at the top of
the clone, on every platform:

| Platform | Game | Start by double click |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `./bin/open1602` | from the menu after `cmake --install` (below) |
| macOS | `./bin/Open1602.app/Contents/MacOS/Open1602` or `open bin/Open1602.app` | `Open1602.app` in Finder |
| Windows | `bin\open1602.exe` (with `SDL3.dll` beside it) | `open1602.exe` in Explorer |

The program carries the application icon on Windows (`open1602.exe`) and macOS (`Open1602.app`). On
Linux, `cmake --install build/release --prefix ~/.local` installs the game into `~/.local/bin` with its
desktop entry and icon, so it appears in the desktop's application menu (the entry starts `open1602`,
so `~/.local/bin` must be on the `PATH`, as it is on most distributions). The other presets (`debug`,
`asan`, `tsan`, `ci`, `coverage`) keep their programs in `build/<preset>/bin/`, so a development build
never replaces the one for playing.

Without arguments the game starts in the main menu. Some more ways to start:

```sh
open1602 --intro                                   # the logos and the intro first, as the original
open1602 --scenario "Szenes/Das Atoll.szs"         # a scenario of the installation
open1602 --new-game 1 --name Merlin                # a new endless game, difficulty 0 (easy) .. 3 (hard)
open1602 --savegame NAME                           # a savegame of the original by its name
open1602 --load path/to/game.o1602                 # a savegame of Open1602
```

An option the game does not know, for example `--help`, prints every option and the default keys
(and exits with code 2).

In the game **F1** shows the keys (they can be changed in `keys.cfg`). W A S D, Q, E and the group
digits work by their place on the keyboard, so they lie the same on QWERTY, QWERTZ and AZERTY; the
other letters go by what is printed on the key (B builds). **F12** saves a screenshot in
`screenshots/` of the data folder. Savegames, settings and key settings are kept in the user's data
folder, never in the installation:

| Platform | Data folder |
|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.local/share/Open1602/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Open1602/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Open1602\` |

A multiplayer host takes players on UDP port 16020 (or the one given with `--port`) and answers the
local network's game search on UDP port 16021. A firewall on the host must let both in, otherwise
its game does not appear in the lobby of the other computers and joining by address fails too. With
ufw on Linux:

```sh
sudo ufw allow 16020:16021/udp comment 'Open1602'
# or only from the home network:
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.178.0/24 to any port 16020:16021 proto udp comment 'Open1602'
```

A computer that only joins needs no rule to join, but its own firewall may drop the hosts' answers to
the game search. It also needs the rule to take over the game when the host leaves (host migration).
For players on the internet the host's router must forward port 16020.

Tests that need the original data run when `ANNO1602_DIR` is set and skip themselves otherwise.
How to run the tests, filter them and use their environment variables: [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).

## Tools

`o1602-tool` (in `bin/` beside the game, or `build/<preset>/bin/` for the development presets) inspects
and converts the original's files:

```sh
o1602-tool chunks     <file>                         # chunk structure of any binary file
o1602-tool cod        haeuser.cod haeuser.txt        # decrypt a .cod script
o1602-tool bsh-export GFX/SHIP.BSH out/ --sheet      # sprites as PNG
o1602-tool islands    NORD/big.scp                   # island data
o1602-tool cod-dump   haeuser.cod --type HAUS        # interpret a .cod script
o1602-tool render-island NORD/lar01.SCP island.png   # draw an island isometrically
o1602-tool render-world "Szenes/Das Atoll.szs" w.png # draw a whole world map
o1602-tool savegames                                 # the savegames of the installation with their names
o1602-tool bsh-info   GFX/SHIP.BSH                   # list the sprites of a sheet
o1602-tool smk        VideoSmk/58.smk --png out/     # decode a Smacker video, frames as PNG
o1602-tool state      SAVEGAME/game00.gam            # players, cities, warehouses, ships of a game
o1602-tool new-world  world.gam --world 900x600      # an own world as a savegame for the original
o1602-tool export     game.o1602 game.gam            # export a game for the original
o1602-tool bench      --players 8 --minutes 600      # run a game headless and measure it (docs/performance.md)
```

Without arguments `o1602-tool` lists every command with its options.
